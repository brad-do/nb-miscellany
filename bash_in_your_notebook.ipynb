    "# Bash in Your Notebook\n",
    "At work recently, I had to call an internal REST API.  To try the API out, I fired up my Ubuntu in my Windows Subsystem for Linux and ran a cURL command to try out the interface.  That went well, so I created a new Jupyter Notebook in which to call the API--I wanted to take the load them into a pandas dataframe, and create a chart across the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I called the API with the [requests](https://realpython.com/python-requests/) and promptly received a SSL \"bad handshake\" error.  [Like many others](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28667684/python-requests-getting-sslerror), I struggled to resolve this error.  Clearly, the server hosting that API was malconfigured in some way.  However, I didn't own the server and had no real recourse to get the issue fixed, so I decided to call cURL directly from my notebook and this led me to the [bash magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-bash).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the *bash* magic command, you can mark tell Jupyter Notebook to run all the commands in your cell as if you were executing them at a bash command prompt...even if you're running Jupyter Notebook on a Windows operating system.  How cool is that?!  Furthermore, with the *out* argument, you can pipe all your cell output to a variable for easy processing.  Check this out:<br><br>\n",
