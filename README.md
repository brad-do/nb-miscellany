# Overview
This project represents a collection of different Jupyter Notebooks I've written to solve various problems.  It didn't seem to make sense to create new projects for each one, so I've included all of them together into one, miscellaneous project.  I'll be adding more notebooks over time, more than likely.

## bash_in_your_notebook.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating the cool bash magic command feature of Jupyter Notebooks.

## college_tuition_vs_starting_salary.ipynb
Here, I take a crack at drawing a cool bubble chart in matplotlib with college tuition and salary data.

## download_them_all.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating a way to download a whole bunch of files on a website all at once.

## multiline_line_strings.ipynb
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), of course, says that your line lengths shouldn't be longer than 79 characters.  So, what do you do when you have long string values, particularly strings that you'd like to span multiple lines, such as SQL statements?  Well, Python has a number of options at your disposal.  This notebook outlines several of those.

## python_bingo.ipynb
A simple and fun way to create bingo cards for all your bingo needs!

## ocr_fun.ipynb
A notebook that does a couple of cool things: 1) it demonstrates a way how you might be able to interact with a Linux sub-system installed on your Windows 10 workstation and 2) run the [tesseract utility](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) within that Linux sub-system to OCR an image.

## poverty.ipynb
A notebook that plots the US poverty rate and annotates the plot as to when key legislation was enacted.

## read_html_part1.ipynb
A notebook providing an example of pandas' powerful read_html function.

## rick_rolling.ipynb
Here's a silly little notebook, inspired by [this](https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/lacroix) [Little Miss Data](https://www.littlemissdata.com/) post, where I try to figure out to drop an animated GIF on top of a matplotlib chart.

## slope_chart.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating how you might be able to use a slope chart in your work.

## things_to_do_in_markdown.ipynb
A notebook of ways I like to use markdown cells in my notebooks.

## venn_diagrams.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating a great way to create Venn Diagrams.
