# Overview
This project represents a collection of different Jupyter Notebooks I've written to solve various problems.  It didn't seem to make sense to create new projects for each one, so I've included all of them together into one, miscellaneous project.  I'll be adding more notebooks over time, more than likely.

## download_them_all.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating a way to download a whole bunch of files on a website all at once.

## multiline_line_strings.ipynb
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), of course, says that your line lengths shouldn't be longer than 79 characters.  So, what do you do when you have long string values, particularly strings that you'd like to span multiple lines, such as SQL statements?  Well, Python has a number of options at your disposal.  This notebook outlines several of those.

## rick_rolling.ipynb
Here's a silly little notebook, inspired by [this](https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/lacroix) [Little Miss Data](https://www.littlemissdata.com/) post, where I try to figure out to drop an animated GIF on top of a matplotlib chart.

## venn_diagrams.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating a great way to create Venn Diagrams.
